Gödel numbering
Problem

In mathematical logic, a Gödel numbering is a function that assigns to each symbol a unique natural number, called its Gödel number.

Lets L = [σ1, σ2, σ3, ..., σn] be a list of symbols and s = σi1σi2...σim, 1 ≤ ij ≤ n for 1 ≤ j ≤ m be a string statement derived from the symbols of L. Then we can encode the statement as a natural number in the folowing way:

g(s) = 2i1 x 3i2 x ... x Pim where P is the next prime number.

For example, if we have a list of symbols: ["0", "="] and a statement 0=0 then the encoding is:

g("0=0") = 2^1 x 3^2 x 51 = 90

Find the natural number representation g(s) of a given list of symbols L and a statament s.

Input Format

The first line contains the list of possible symbols L

The second line contains the statement s

There are no emty spaces between the symbols.

Constraints

|L| <= 11
|s| <= 35
Output Format

A natural number represented as a String

Sample Input 0

0,=
0=0
Sample Output 0

90
Explanation 0

g("0=0") = 21 x 32 x 51 = 90
Sample Input 1

2,=,1,+
1+1=2
Sample Output 1

43659000
Explanation 1

g("1+1=2") = 23 x 34 x 53 x 72 x 111 = 43659000
