A way out

Problem
You are working with a client who owns an escape room.
The room consists of a locked door, different objects to manipulate as well as hidden clues or secret compartments.
The task is to get out of the room.
The exit is through a door which is opened with a combination 
	of the following symbols “{“,”}”,”(“,”)”,”[“,”]”.
As the game progresses you discover symbols one by one 
and if you are playing correctly the door will open at the end of the game. 
Your task is to program the door to open only when the right combination of symbols is entered.

An input combination is valid if:

-Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.

-Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

For example, the program should print true “[()]{}{()()}” and false for “[(])”
