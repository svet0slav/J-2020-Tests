Joe and Ann have a secret code to exchange messages.They encode their messages by replacing each character with a different one. For example "hello" becomes "rkoos" by using the following substitutions "h->r, e->k, l->o, o->s". Using such substitutions the original message can be converted to the encoded one and vice-versa unambiguously. But mistakes happen and sometimes they send the wrong message and they need your help.Write a program that checks if the message is encoded correctly before they send it.

Print true if the encoding is correct and false if it is not.

For example, egg and add return true, foo and bar return false.
