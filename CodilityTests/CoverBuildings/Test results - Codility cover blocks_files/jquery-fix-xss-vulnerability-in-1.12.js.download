  Manual fix for an XSS vulnerability reported in the Qualys web application audit report here:
  https://gitlab.codility.net/codility/codility/issues/133

  The audit report recommends upgrading jQuery to 1.12 where the vulnerability was fixed, but as described in
  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2432, the fix was intended only for versions 3.0 and up, and the backport
  to 1.12 was an error and a breaking change, and thus subsequently reverted in 1.12.3.

  As discussed in the linked jQuery issue thread, the only recommended ways to solve this issue are:

  - upgrade from 1.x to 3.0.0, which we don't have time for given how much legacy code there still is,
  - add a manual patch just after loading jQuery, which is what this function is for.

(function( jQuery ) {
  // Prevent auto-execution of scripts when no explicit dataType was provided (See gh-2432)
  jQuery.ajaxPrefilter( function( s ) {
      if ( s.crossDomain ) {
          s.contents.script = false;
      }
  } );
})( jQuery );
